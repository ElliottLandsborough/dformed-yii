</p>
<h2>Domain Names, Domain Transfers</h2>
<p>
In order for your domain name to point to the d-formed server your new account is on, you must change your DNS (Domain Name Servers) at your registrar. This process is not known as a domain 
transfer. d-formed.net will take necessary steps to register domain names on behalf of the client when requested. However, clients are required to ask, in email, for a renewal of there domain. d-formed 
takes no responsibility for renewing domains unless it has been asked to.
</p>

the areas of storage and traffic. We will never charge you automatically if your account requires more resources. You must keep your email address with us updated, so that you may
receive an email when your account reaches certain limits determined solely by our system. At which time you may contact us to purchase a higher transfer quota for your account. If you do not contact us, 
the system will suspend your site if your allotments exceed.

services prematurely.<br />

becomes suspended and remains suspended it will be deleted after a 30-day period.
</p>
<h2>UCE, UBE, Spam</h2>
<p>
d-formed.net has a zero tolerance policy regarding unsolicited commercial email (UCE) and unsolicited bulk email (UBE) also known as "spam". Spam is the act of sending unsolicited email. You will be
cited with UCE/UBE abuse if you send any email to persons who have not specifically asked to receive email from you. The sending origin of such email is irrelevant. If your d-formed Hosting-hosted 
site is referenced in any way within such an email, then you will be cited for UCE/UBE. Upon confirmation of abuse, any d-formed.net customer engaging in this practice will have their service suspended 
and terminated immediately without refund. Not only does spam place a strain on the server that can negatively effect that server's uptime record and performance record, you subject that server to be 
blacklisted.
